This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to data truncation when using the MOVE statement. The bug occurs when moving data from a source field to a target field with a smaller length.  The solution provides a way to detect and handle such truncation errors, ensuring data integrity.  This is a common, yet often overlooked, error in COBOL programs.
